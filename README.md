   ```

## Usage

### 📊 **Pokemon Data Resource**

Access comprehensive Pokemon data using the resource URI pattern:

```
mcp://pokemon-server/pokemon/{pokemon_name}
```

**Example**: `mcp://pokemon-server/pokemon/pikachu`

**Returns**:
- Basic information (ID, types, height, weight)
- Complete base stats with total
- All abilities
- Evolution chain progression
- Detailed move information (first 5 moves with full details)
- Additional move names for reference

### 🔥 **Battle Simulation Tool**

Simulate realistic battles between any two Pokemon:

```python
simulate_battle(pokemon1_name: str, pokemon2_name: str) -> str
```

**Example**: Simulate a battle between Pikachu and Charizard

**Features**:
- Speed-based turn order
- Type effectiveness calculations
- Status effect mechanics (Paralysis, Burn, Poison)
- Detailed turn-by-turn battle logs
- Winner determination

### 🎯 **Type Effectiveness Tool**

Check type matchups for strategic planning:

```python
get_type_effectiveness(attacking_type: str, defending_type: str) -> str
```

**Example**: Check how Fire attacks affect Grass types

**Returns**:
- Damage multiplier information
- Effectiveness description (Super effective, Not very effective, etc.)

### 🛡️ **Pokemon Type Analysis Tool**

Get comprehensive defensive analysis for any Pokemon:

```python
get_pokemon_weaknesses_and_resistances(pokemon_name: str) -> str
```

**Example**: Analyze Charizard's defensive matchups

**Returns**:
- All weaknesses with damage multipliers
- All resistances with damage reduction
- Complete immunities
- Strategic recommendations

#### `simulate_battle(pokemon1_name, pokemon2_name)`
- **Description**: Simulates a battle between two Pokemon
- **Parameters**:
  - `pokemon1_name`: Name of the first Pokemon
  - `pokemon2_name`: Name of the second Pokemon
- **Returns**: Detailed battle log with turn-by-turn actions and winner

#### `get_type_effectiveness(attacking_type, defending_type)`
- **Description**: Gets type effectiveness multiplier
- **Parameters**:
  - `attacking_type`: The attacking move's type
  - `defending_type`: The defending Pokemon's type
- **Returns**: Effectiveness information and damage multiplier

#### `get_pokemon_weaknesses_and_resistances(pokemon_name)`
- **Description**: Analyzes a Pokemon's defensive type matchups
- **Parameters**:
  - `pokemon_name`: Name of the Pokemon to analyze
- **Returns**: Complete breakdown of weaknesses, resistances, and immunities

## Battle Mechanics

### Type Effectiveness Chart
The server implements a comprehensive type effectiveness chart with 18 Pokemon types:
- **Super Effective**: 2x damage
- **Not Very Effective**: 0.5x damage  
- **No Effect**: 0x damage
- **Dual Types**: Multipliers stack (e.g., 2x × 2x = 4x damage)

### Status Effects
1. **Paralysis**: 25% chance to skip turn
2. **Burn**: Reduces attack damage by 50%, deals 1/8 max HP damage per turn
3. **Poison**: Deals 1/8 max HP damage per turn

### Damage Calculation
```
Damage = (((2/5 + 2) × Move Power × (Attack / Defense)) / 50) × Type Effectiveness + 2
```

## Data Source

This server uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch real-time Pokemon data, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

## Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- FastMCP framework
- httpx for API requests
- PokeAPI
- uv for connecting claude to mcp server.

### How to connect this with Claude Client

To connect your Pokemon MCP Server with Claude Desktop, follow these steps:

#### 1. **Install Claude Desktop**
Download and install Claude Desktop from [Anthropic's website](https://claude.ai/desktop).

#### 2. **Configure MCP Server in Claude**
Claude Desktop uses a configuration file to connect to MCP servers. You need to add your Pokemon server to this configuration.

**For Windows:**
1. Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### 3. **Verify Connection**
Once Claude Desktop restarts, you should see the Pokemon MCP Server available. You can test it by:

1. **Testing the Resource**: Ask Claude to access Pokemon data:
   ```
   "Can you get information about Pikachu using the Pokemon resource?"
   ```

2. **Testing Battle Simulation**: Ask Claude to simulate a battle:
   ```
   "Can you simulate a battle between Charizard and Blastoise?"
   ```

3. **Testing Type Analysis**: Ask Claude to analyze type effectiveness:
   ```
   "What are Garchomp's weaknesses and resistances?"
   ```
